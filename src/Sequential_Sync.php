	/**
	 * Stores the sequence of sync jobs to be executed.
	 *
	 * This array holds instances of the `Sync` class, each representing a specific synchronization job
	 * that is part of a sequential synchronization process. The `$jobs` array is initialized with the
	 * sync tasks returned by the `get_jobs()` method, which needs to be implemented by classes extending
	 * from `Sequential_Sync`.
	 *
	 * ### Purpose:
	 * - The `$jobs` variable ensures that all synchronization jobs are loaded and managed as part of the
	 *   sequence. These jobs are not instantiated on every page load but only when the synchronization
	 *   process is initiated, keeping resource usage efficient.
	 *
	 * ### Usage:
	 * - The `queue_init()` method initializes this property with the return value of `get_jobs()`
	 *   and registers hooks for each jobâ€™s specific sync behavior.
	 * - It provides the functionality to enqueue and process these jobs in the correct order during
	 *   the synchronization cycle.
	 * - The jobs can communicate and share synchronization data through the `sync_data_name` property
	 *   and hooks registered for actions like job completion or intermediate steps.
	 *
	 * ### When to Use:
	 * - Use `$jobs` when scheduling or managing multiple sync tasks as part of a sequential process.
	 * - Any job that needs to be executed as part of the sequence must be registered in the array via
	 *   the `get_jobs()` method.
	 * - It is especially useful for applications where sync tasks must follow a specific logical order
	 *   for successful execution.
	 *
	 * ### Example Use Case:
	 * - Suppose you have a series of data synchronization tasks where data from one sync operation is
	 *   necessary for the next. You would define these tasks as instances of `Sync` and return them in
	 *   `get_jobs()`. They are then stored in `$jobs` and executed sequentially, ensuring proper order
	 *   and data integrity.
	 *
	 * @var Sync[] Array of `Sync` instances representing the jobs to be executed sequentially.
